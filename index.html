          <h3>Taxonomy and Evolution</h3>
          <p>Bears belong to the family Ursidae, within the order Carnivora. The family includes eight extant species:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>American Black Bear (Ursus americanus)</li>

             <li> Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)</li>
              
             <li>Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus)</li>
              
             <li>Asiatic Black Bear (Ursus thibetanus)</li>
              
             <li>Sun Bear (Helarctos malayanus)</li>
              
             <li>Sloth Bear (Melursus ursinus)</li>
              
             <li>Spectacled Bear (Tremarctos ornatus)</li>
              
             <li>Giant Panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The evolutionary lineage of bears dates back approximately 38 million years. The earliest known bear-like ancestor is Parictis, a small, weasel-like animal. Over millions of years, bears evolved diverse traits suited to their environments, including omnivorous diets and a range of fur types and body sizes. </p>

          <h3> Physical Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
          
            Bears exhibit considerable variation in size and appearance, depending on the species. Adult weights range from about 25–65 kg (55–143 lb) in sun bears to over 600 kg (1,320 lb) in polar bears. Most bears have large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, and short tails. They possess five non-retractable claws on each paw, which aid in climbing, digging, and catching prey.
            Despite their bulk, bears are surprisingly agile. Some species are excellent climbers, such as the American black bear and the Asiatic black bear. Polar bears are strong swimmers, adapted to life on ice and in Arctic waters, with large, paddle-like paws.

          <h3> Habitats and Geographic Distribution</h3>
          <p>Bears are found across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Their habitats range from the Arctic tundra and alpine meadows to dense forests and tropical lowlands.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>American Black Bear: Widespread across North America, from Canada to Mexico, favoring forested regions.</li>

            <li>Brown Bear: Found in North America, Europe, and Asia. Subspecies include the grizzly bear (North America) and the Kodiak bear (Alaska).</li>
            
            <li>Polar Bear: Native to the Arctic Circle, relying on sea ice to hunt seals.</li>
            
            <li>Asiatic Black Bear: Inhabits forested regions of southern Asia.</li>
            
            <li>Sun Bear: Lives in the tropical rainforests of Southeast Asia.</li>
            
            <li>Sloth Bear: Found in the Indian subcontinent, inhabiting tropical forests and grasslands.</li>
            
            <li>Spectacled Bear: The only South American bear, residing in the Andes Mountains.</li>
            
            <li>Giant Panda: Native to mountainous regions of central China, dependent on bamboo forests.</li>
            
            </ul>
        </div>


        
        <div class="fact4 fact">
          <h3>Diet and Feeding Habits</h3>
          <P>Although classified as carnivores, bears are generally omnivorous, with diets varying by species and season. Their dietary flexibility allows them to adapt to diverse environments.</P>
          <ul>
            <li>American and Brown Bears: Omnivorous, eating berries, nuts, insects, fish (notably salmon), and small mammals.</li>

              <li>Polar Bears: Primarily carnivorous, feeding almost exclusively on seals.</li>

                <li>Asiatic Black and Sun Bears: Omnivorous, consuming fruits, insects, and small animals.</li>

                  <li>Sloth Bears: Specialize in eating termites and ants.</li>

                    <li>Spectacled Bears: Largely herbivorous, eating fruits, bromeliads, and other vegetation.</li>

                      <li>Giant Pandas: Over 99% of their diet consists of bamboo.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="fact5 fact">
          <h3> Behavior and Social Structure</h3>

            <p>Bears are mostly solitary animals, coming together only for mating or when mothers are raising cubs. However, high food availability can lead to temporary aggregations, such as salmon runs attracting multiple brown bears.
            
            Bears communicate using vocalizations, scent markings, and body language. They are known for their intelligence, with some species displaying problem-solving abilities and tool use. Bears hibernate during winter in colder regions, reducing their metabolic rate to conserve energy.

        </div>
        <div class="fact6 fact">
          <h3>Reproduction and Lifespan</h3>

          <p>Mating seasons vary by species but often occur in late spring to early summer. Bears exhibit delayed implantation, where the fertilized egg does not immediately implant in the uterus. This adaptation allows cubs to be born during hibernation, when the mother is in a den.
          
          Litter sizes typically range from one to four cubs, depending on species and environmental conditions. Cubs are born blind, hairless, and entirely dependent on their mother. They stay with her for one to three years, learning survival skills.
          
          In the wild, bears can live from 20 to 30 years, though lifespans vary by species and threats from humans and environmental factors.</p>
        </div>
    
        <div class="fact7 fact" id="threat">
          <H3> Threats to Bear Populations</H3>
          <p>Despite their adaptability, many bear species face significant threats:</p>
          <ol>
           <LI> Habitat Loss: Deforestation, urbanization, and agricultural expansion reduce the availability of bear habitats.</LI>
            <li>Climate Change: Especially critical for polar bears, who depend on sea ice for hunting.</li>

              <li>Human-Wildlife Conflict: Bears sometimes prey on livestock or forage in human settlements, leading to retaliatory killings.</li>
              
                <li>Poaching and Illegal Trade: Bears are hunted for their gall bladders, paws, and pelts, especially in traditional medicine markets.</li>
              
                  <li>Fragmentation: Roads and infrastructure can isolate populations, reducing genetic diversity and increasing mortality.</li>

          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="fact8 fact">
          <h3> Conservation Efforts</h3>
          <p>International and national conservation efforts aim to protect bears through legislation, habitat preservation, and public education.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Protected Areas: National parks and reserves provide safe habitats for bears.</li>

              <li>Legal Protection: CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) regulates the trade of bear parts.</li>
            
                <li> Research and Monitoring: Tracking populations and studying behavior helps inform conservation strategies.</li>
            
                  <li>Community Engagement: Involving local communities in conservation reduces conflict and encourages coexistence.</li>
            
                    <li> Captive Breeding and Rehabilitation: Programs like those for the giant panda have seen notable success in increasing population numbers.</li>
          </ul>
